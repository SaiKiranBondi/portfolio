# Deployment Commands for Your Portfolio

This document summarizes the commands and steps taken to deploy your React portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## 1. Initial Deployment Steps

### 1.1 Check Git Status (Agent Action)
The agent first checked if a Git repository was already initialized.
```bash
git status
```
*(Output indicated a repository was already initialized with uncommitted changes.)*

### 1.2 Install `gh-pages` (Agent Action)
The `gh-pages` package was installed as a development dependency to facilitate deployment to GitHub Pages.
```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

### 1.3 Update `package.json` (Agent Action & User Input)
The agent read your `package.json` file to prepare for modifications.
```bash
# Agent reads package.json
read_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/package.json
```
The `scripts` section was updated to include `predeploy` and `deploy` commands.
```bash
# Agent modifies package.json scripts
replace_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/package.json \
  old_string="  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }," \
  new_string="  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },"
```
The agent then requested your GitHub username to set the `homepage` field.
*(User provided: `SaiKiranBondi`)*
The `homepage` field was added to `package.json`.
```bash
# Agent adds homepage to package.json
replace_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/package.json \
  old_string="  "private": true," \
  new_string="  "private": true,
  "homepage": "https://SaiKiranBondi.github.io/portfolio",""
```

### 1.4 User Action: Create Empty GitHub Repository
**Before proceeding, you needed to create an empty public repository on GitHub.**
*   Go to `https://github.com/new`
*   Create a **new public repository** named `portfolio`.
*   **Do not initialize it with a README or any other files.**

### 1.5 Add Remote Origin (Agent Action)
The remote origin for your local Git repository was set to point to your GitHub repository.
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/SaiKiranBondi/portfolio.git
```

### 1.6 Initial Commit (Agent Action)
The changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` were committed.
```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json && git commit -m "Add gh-pages and deployment scripts"
```

### 1.7 Push to GitHub (Agent Action)
The committed changes were pushed to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.8 Deploy to GitHub Pages (Agent Action)
The application was built and deployed to GitHub Pages.
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 1.9 Verify Initial Deployment (User Action)
You were asked to verify the deployment at `https://SaiKiranBondi.github.io/portfolio`.
*(Initial verification resulted in a 404 error.)*

### 1.10 Troubleshooting 404 Error (User Action)
You were guided to check your GitHub Pages settings:
1.  Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/SaiKiranBondi/portfolio`
2.  Click on **"Settings"** -> **"Pages"**.
3.  Ensure **"Source"** is set to **"Deploy from a branch"**.
4.  For the **"Branch"**, ensure it's set to **`gh-pages`** and the folder is `/ (root)`.
5.  Click **"Save"** if you make any changes.
*(You confirmed the app was then visible, but with some issues.)*

### 1.11 Update Title and Favicon (Agent Action)
The agent read `public/index.html` to prepare for modifications.
```bash
# Agent reads public/index.html
read_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/public/index.html
```
The title in `public/index.html` was changed from "React App" to "Saikiran Portfolio".
```bash
# Agent changes title
replace_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/public/index.html \
  old_string="<title>React App</title>" \
  new_string="<title>Saikiran Portfolio</title>"
```
The favicon and Apple Touch Icon were updated to use `profile.png`.
```bash
# Agent updates favicon
replace_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/public/index.html \
  old_string="<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />" \
  new_string="<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/images/profile.png\" />"

# Agent updates Apple Touch Icon
replace_file /home/saikiran/Downloads/DocsSpace/Portfolio/portfolio/public/index.html \
  old_string="<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png\" />" \
  new_string="<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/images/profile.png\" />"
```

### 1.12 Commit and Push Updates (Agent Action)
The changes to `public/index.html` were committed and pushed to GitHub.
```bash
git add public/index.html && git commit -m "Update title and favicon to profile image"
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.13 Final Deployment (Agent Action)
The updated application was deployed to GitHub Pages.
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 2. Subsequent Deployments (After Making Changes)

Once your initial setup is complete, and you've made further changes to your code (e.g., updated components, `data.js`, styles), follow these steps to update your live site:

### 2.1 Commit Your Changes
First, commit all your local changes to your Git repository.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message about your changes"
```
*(Replace "Descriptive commit message about your changes" with a brief summary of what you've done.)*

### 2.2 Push to GitHub
Push your committed changes to your GitHub repository.
```bash
git push
```

### 2.3 Deploy to GitHub Pages
Finally, run the deploy script to build your application and push it to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages serves.
```bash
npm run deploy
```
Your site will be updated shortly after this command completes successfully.
